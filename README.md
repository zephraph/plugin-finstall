**This plugin is a work-in-progress, use at your own risk**

Adds a `finstall` function that manages that installs a package via a specified package manager but keeps track of what's installed so you can easily get set up in a different environment.

## Install

```fish
$ omf install https://github.com/zephraph/plugin-finstall
```

## Usage

For package managers that are supported (currently only `brew`) just install your dependencies like normal

```fish
$ brew install exa
```

If the `brew install` command is successful an entry will by default be added into `~/.config/fish/finstall_packages`.

You can update the location of the finstall config file by setting the `FINSTALL_CONFIG` environment variable
